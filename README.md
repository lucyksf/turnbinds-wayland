# Turnbinds for Wayland
This is an application written in C to bring turnbinds (just like AHK) to Wayland on Linux :)

# How to find your sensitivity
## Run ``evtest`` and find your mouse input, then run
###
## ``sudo libinput debug-events --device /dev/input/eventX`` X=your mouse input number
###
## Move your mouse steadily for a few seconds, you'll see a lot of ``event3   POINTER_MOTION    6446    +15.366s    0.00/  0.21 ( +0.00/ +1.00)``, the number 6446 will be different for you depending on your sensitivity, this number is what you want to save. Now you'll need to note your monitor's refresh rate. The equation goes as follows: POINTER_MOTION / REFRESH_RATE â‰ˆ XX. This will be your number to put inside the usleep() function at the bottom of the code.
## Inside the code, you can adjust the usleep() function at the bottom and change your left_speed, light_speed and override_speed accordingly.

# Requirements
## Debian/Ubuntu
``sudo apt update``
###
``sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers``

## Arch (-based) systems
``sudo pacman -S base-devel linux-headers``

## Compiling
``gcc -o turnbinds turnbinds.c``

## Usage
``sudo ./turnbinds``
### sudo is required due to uinputs needing kernel access, it's possible to run without root, although I find it to be a bit convoluted

### How to do it:

## Create a udev rule
``sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules``
###
``sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules``

### Add the following:
``KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"``
###
``KERNEL=="event*", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"``

## Add your user to the ``input`` group
``sudo usermod -aG input $USER``

## Reload udev
``sudo udevadm control --reload-rules``
###
``sudo udevadm trigger``
#### And relogin/restart
